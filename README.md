### Hey ðŸ‘‹!, I'm Jonathan

I enjoy front-end development as well as user experience design. I find the initial design process and then the technical transition into coding said designs to be a lot of fun. I enjy reading books across many different genres, some of which being: self-help, sci-fi, non-fiction, and biographies.

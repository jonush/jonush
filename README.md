### Hey! I'm Jon 🦦

I'm a self-taught designer with development experience. I graduated from a coding bootcamp for full-stack web development in 2020; during my time there, I built front-end web applications as well as back-end API's. I'm currently focused on UI design, with interest in optimizing the collaborative experience between designers and developers.

My current interests include:

- Design Systems 🛠
- Crypto art & NFT's ⚡️
- Playing Tennis 🎾
- Going to the Beach 🏖

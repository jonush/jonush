### Hey! I'm Jon 🦦

I'm a self-taught designer with development experience. I graduated from a coding bootcamp for full-stack web development in 2020—during my time there, I built front-end web applications as well as back-end API's. I'm currently focused on UI design and optimizing the collabroative experience between designers and developers.

My current interests include:

- Crypto art & NFT's
- Design Systems
- Playing Tennis 🎾 & Going to the Beach 🏖

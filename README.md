### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jonathan

I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for UX development. I appreciate the design process and then the technical transition into coding said designs. I am an advocate for implementing accessiblity throughout all aspects of what I build.

My interests include:

- Browsing the Figma community plug-ins and templates
- Diving into CSS/UI libraries and using them in ReactJS
- Playing ðŸŽ¾

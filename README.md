### Hey! I'm Jon 🦦

I'm a self-taught designer with development experience. I graduated from a coding bootcamp for full-stack web development in 2020, gaining experience building multiple front-end web applications and back-end API's. I'm currently focused on UI engineering, with an interest in exploring the collaborative experience between designers and developers.

My current interests include:

- Design Systems 🛠
- Crypto art & NFT's ⚡️
- Playing Tennis 🎾
- Going to the Beach 🏖

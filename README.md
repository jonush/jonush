### Hey! I'm Jon 🦦

I'm a self-taught designer with full-stack development experience. I graduated from a coding bootcamp for full-stack web development in 2020, gaining experience building multiple front-end web applications and back-end API's. I'm currently pursuing UX/UI design roles, with an interest in designing intuitive web experiences.

My current interests include:

- Design Systems 🛠
- Playing Tennis 🎾
- Going to the Beach 🏖
